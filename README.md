# HTML / CSS

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a powerful CSS layout module that provides a flexible and efficient way to arrange and align elements within a container. It offers a comprehensive set of properties and values that enable developers to create responsive and dynamic layouts for web applications.

## Getting Started

To use Flexbox, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Create an HTML file and link a CSS file to it.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

1. In the CSS file, define a container element and apply the `display: flex` property to it.

```
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

1. Add child elements inside the container, which will become flex items.

```
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```
1. Style the flex items using various Flexbox properties.

```
.item {
  flex: 1;
}
```

## Flexbox Concepts

Flexbox operates on two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the `flex-direction` property, while the cross axis is perpendicular to it.

Key concepts of Flexbox include:

**Flex Container**: The parent element with `display: flex` applied. It establishes a new flex formatting context for its children.

**Flex Items**: The child elements of a flex container. They can be aligned and arranged using various Flexbox properties.

**Main Axis**: The primary axis along which flex items are laid out. It can be either horizontal (row) or vertical (column), defined by `flex-direction`.

**Cross Axis**: The perpendicular axis to the main axis. It can be horizontal or vertical, depending on the `flex-direction`.

**Flexbox Properties**: A set of CSS properties that control the behavior of flex items, including `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `flex-flow`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and many more.

**Flex Item Properties**: Additional properties that can be applied to individual flex items, such as `flex`, `order`, `align-self`, and `flex-basis`.

## Flexbox Properties
Flexbox offers a variety of properties to control the layout and alignment of flex items. Some of the most commonly used properties include:

- `display`: Specifies the element as a flex container.
+ `flex-direction`: Defines the main axis direction (row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse).
* `flex-wrap`: Determines whether flex items should wrap (nowrap, wrap, or wrap-reverse).
- `flex-flow`: Shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.
+ `justify-content`: Aligns flex items along the main axis (`flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, or `space-evenly`).
* `align-items`: Aligns flex items along the cross axis (`flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, or `stretch`).
+ `align-content`: Aligns multiple lines of flex items along the cross axis (`flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, or `stretch`).
- `flex`: Specifies the flex grow, flex shrink, and flex basis of a flex item.
+ `order`: Sets the order of a flex item relative to the other items.
* `align-self`: Overrides the `align-items` property for a specific flex item.
- `flex-basis`: Defines the initial size of a flex item.

These properties allow you to create responsive and adaptive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Conclusion
Flexbox is a powerful tool for building flexible and responsive layouts in CSS. By understanding the core concepts and properties of Flexbox, you can create dynamic designs that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. Experiment with different properties and values to achieve the desired layout and alignment for your web applications.
